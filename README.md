# Simon Game
This was supposed to be a quick short project to take a little break from the coures I'm following and to pracice what I've already learned.

The rules I had set at the beginning turned it into quite a challenge! 
I needed to delve deep into some topic that I didn't expect 😆

## What I learned

* I went deeeep into JS `Promise`, `async`, `await` After a very challenging and discouraging start I persevered throug I was able to learn soo much about! It'll be very useful and empowering moving forward 💪🏻
* `clip-path: shape()`
* new event types for event handler: `load`, `animationend`
* Working with `@keyframes` in conjunction with JS, using `var()` to create reusable animations, and styles
